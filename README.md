## Motivation

x.com is a noisy social-media app and I want to try building an actual social-media platform for coders.

- Vision:
  - Gather feedback from community regarding features.
  - Keep it open-source and attract PRs.
  - If it scales beyond a certain traffic then look for sponsors.

## How do I build this ?

Video soon on my [YTChannel](https://www.youtube.com/@raj_talks_tech/videos)

## Getting Started

### Local Development

I have already prepared a supabase project based on my YT course, and Github OAuth app, which would enable you to login and build features. The details are in `.env.stage`.

You can copy the `.env.stage` into your `.env` file, and run the remix-app at `localhost:3000` to use all the features.

If you do the above step right, then your app should be running locally.

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Roadmap

Features I would like to add:

- Adding notifications for "new posts" and when clicked users need to be scrolled to top
- Adding support for uploading images, preferably using S3
